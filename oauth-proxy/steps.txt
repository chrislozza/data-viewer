# OAuth Authentication Flow - UI Details

Yes, step 4 involves a user interface (UI) provided by TastyTrade. Let me clarify the complete flow with UI details:

## Step-by-Step Flow with UI Elements

1. **User starts in your application UI**
   - User clicks a "Connect to TastyTrade" button in your app

2. **Your app redirects to Lambda proxy**
   - Browser navigates to `https://your-lambda-api.amazonaws.com/authorize?session_id=abc123`

3. **Lambda redirects to TastyTrade login page**
   - Browser navigates to TastyTrade's authorization page
   - URL: `https://my.tastytrade.com/auth.html?client_id=YOUR_ID&redirect_uri=...`

4. **User interacts with TastyTrade's login UI**
   - User sees TastyTrade's login form
   - User enters username/password
   - If 2FA is enabled, user enters their 2FA code
   - User sees permissions screen showing what your app is requesting access to
   - User clicks "Authorize" button

   (Example image - actual UI may differ)

5. **TastyTrade redirects back to Lambda**
   - After successful authentication, TastyTrade redirects the browser
   - Browser navigates to `https://your-lambda-api.amazonaws.com/callback?code=xyz789&state=abc123`

6. **Lambda processes the code (behind the scenes)**
   - Exchanges code for tokens with TastyTrade API
   - Stores tokens in DynamoDB
   - Shows success page to user: "You can return to the application"

7. **Your K3s app retrieves tokens**
   - Polls Lambda endpoint for token status
   - When available, securely retrieves tokens
   - Uses tokens for API calls to TastyTrade

The key point is that steps 3-5 happen in the user's browser, where they directly interact with TastyTrade's authentication UI. Your Lambda proxy and K3s application don't need to implement this UI - TastyTrade provides it.
