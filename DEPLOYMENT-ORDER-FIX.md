# Deployment Order Fix - Verification

## Problem
When running `recreate` mode, Docker was trying to push to ECR **before** Terraform recreated the repository.

## Before (Broken) üî¥

```
1. Configure AWS credentials
2. Login to ECR
3. Build Docker image
4. Push to ECR ‚ùå FAILS - repository doesn't exist yet!
5. Terraform Destroy (deletes ECR)
6. Terraform Apply (recreates ECR)
7. Deploy to App Runner
```

**Error:** `name unknown: The repository with name 'data-viewer-dashboard' does not exist`

## After (Fixed) ‚úÖ

```
1. Configure AWS credentials
2. Terraform Destroy (if recreate mode)
3. Terraform Apply (creates/updates infrastructure including ECR)
4. Login to ECR
5. Build Docker image
6. Push to ECR ‚úÖ SUCCESS - repository exists!
7. Deploy to App Runner
```

## Verification Results

### Step Order (Line Numbers in workflow)
- **Line 106**: Terraform Destroy
- **Line 124**: Terraform Apply
- **Line 139**: Login to ECR
- **Line 164**: Docker Build/Push
- **Line 233**: App Runner Deploy

### Order Checks
‚úÖ Terraform Apply (124) runs BEFORE Docker Build (164)
‚úÖ ECR Login (139) runs AFTER Terraform Apply (124)
‚úÖ Docker Build (164) runs AFTER ECR Login (139)
‚úÖ App Runner Deploy (233) runs AFTER Docker Build (164)

## Deployment Modes

### `image-only` Mode
- Skips Terraform
- Builds and pushes Docker image
- Deploys to existing App Runner service
- **Use case:** Quick updates when infrastructure already exists

### `apply` Mode
1. Runs Terraform (creates/updates infrastructure)
2. Builds and pushes Docker image
3. Deploys to App Runner
- **Use case:** First deployment or infrastructure updates

### `recreate` Mode
1. Destroys all infrastructure
2. Recreates everything from scratch
3. Builds and pushes Docker image
4. Deploys to App Runner
- **Use case:** Clean slate deployment (URL will change)

## Testing

Run the verification script to confirm the order is correct:

```bash
./verify-workflow-order.sh
```

Expected output: `‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ WORKFLOW ORDER IS CORRECT ‚úÖ ‚úÖ ‚úÖ`

## Summary

The fix ensures that in **all deployment modes**, the ECR repository exists before Docker attempts to push images to it. This is achieved by moving the Docker build/push steps to occur **after** Terraform Apply.
